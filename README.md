## Project details
Our project utilizes a contemporary web development toolkit including PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The objective is to provide users with a smooth interface while emphasizing scalability, security, and ease of maintenance.

### PHP (The MVP of the Backend)
PHP serves as the backbone of our backend. Despite its longevity, PHP remains a robust choice, providing stability and reliability to our application.

### JavaScript
JavaScript plays a crucial role both on the frontend and as a backend companion. Integrated within our PHP codebase, JavaScript seamlessly executes tasks with precision, enhancing user interactions.

### HTML and CSS
HTML and CSS form the foundation of our frontend presentation. Embracing simplicity and elegance, we craft our web pages meticulously to ensure an engaging user experience.

### MySQL
MySQL manages our data with reliability and adherence to relational integrity and ACID compliance. While newer database technologies may offer scalability, MySQL's stability and familiarity are valuable assets to our project.
